# Sticky Notes+ - by Gagandeep Malhotra

Sticky Notes+ is a simple sticky notes application built with Python and Tkinter. I had created this application because I wanted features such as a search bar, custom text size, horizontal margins, and window transparency to be included in a notes application.

## Features

- **Create and Edit Notes**: Easily create and edit notes for quick organization.

- **Search and Highlight**: Find, navigate through, and highlight specific text in your notes.

- **Customisation Options**: Format text with underline as well as adjust zoom and margins.

- **Auto-Save**: Notes are automatically saved in real-time.

- **Transparency and Opacity**: Adjust window transparency to your preference.

- **Word and Character Count**: Keep track of word and character counts.

- **Undo and Redo**: Undo or redo changes.

- **Notes List View**: Switch between notes.

- **Delete Notes**: Delete notes.

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have Python installed.

2. **Installation**: Download and run `main.py` with all the images located in the same folder.

3. **Usage**: Create notes by going to 'File' > 'New Note', and enter a title.
